🌱 0. Project Concept

Your website is a React-based Quiz App built with Vite for fast development and modern JavaScript tooling.
It’s designed to:

Ask users a set of multiple-choice questions.
Show correct and wrong answers visually.
Move through questions one by one.
Display the final score at the end.
Be responsive, clean, and easy to interact with.

🧩 #. The Quiz Component (Logic Behind It)

The main code is in Quiz.jsx.
It uses React Hooks:

Hook	Purpose
useState	To store and update quiz data (current question, score, etc).
useRef	To directly manipulate DOM elements (to highlight answers).

⚙️ Core Functions:
1. checkAns(e, ans)

Compares the user’s selected answer with the correct one.
Adds CSS class .correct or .wrong to visually show the result.
Locks the question so users can’t click again.

2. nextQuestion()

Moves to the next question if the current one is answered.
Clears the previous highlights.
Updates the index and question state.

3. result and score

Tracks how many answers were correct.
Displays the final score after the last question.

🎨 5. Styling (Quiz.css)

You used custom classic CSS with a smooth, clean layout.
.container: central white card with rounded corners.
.correct: green background for correct answers.
.wrong: red background for wrong answers.
.index: shows the question count (e.g., “3 of 10 questions”).
.result: full-screen result view showing the final score.
You also added responsive padding and clean spacing for an elegant look.

*Each question has 4 options.
The ans key holds the correct option number.

At the end of the quiz:
The app hides the questions.
